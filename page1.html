    It's true. Bicycles are the best thing in the world.
    Yes, better than video games.
    Yes, better than hamburgers.
    Yes, better than sex (ussually).
    No, It's not better than true love, but love is an abstract concept, and bikes are, well, concrete objects, so that's not a fiar comparison.

    To better understand why I love these two-weeled, self-propelled, tear-inspiring machines so much,
    We need to talk about motion. In particular, one's ability to move from one place to another.
    As a species, we always tried to invent and derive new ways to move our beatiful asses around the globe (and beyond).
    To achieve this nobal goal we are willing to wage war, digg deep into the earth, and in some cases, change our ecosystem beyond recognition.
    How come? Is it really just about transportation? Just about getting the workers of the world to their boring, grey, sad little offices?
    Is moving around just another piece of the pazzle that is our tragic existance?
    No. Just ask any child with a toy car. Or your nabour with the red tiny sportscar. Or the idiots who lunch themselves into space on top of explosive metal tubes.

    Motion is <strong>freedom</strong>. It is how we achieve ecerything else.
    No matter what you want to do, first, you need to get there don't you?
    Otherwise, it really is all just in your head.
